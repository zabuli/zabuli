- 👋 Hi, I’m @zabuli, a software developer in .NET
- 👀 I’m interested in working with the community, learning new technologies, and trying to do something innovative.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, and after that, I would like to learn python and vue.js. Besides that, I’m currently broadening my horizons in system design.
- 💞️ I would like to offer my skills and contribute to some open-source projects.
